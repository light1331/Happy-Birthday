          <small>i know it's not good enough and not worth as a gift for this precious day but still i tried as much as i could. i had stopped everything when my favorite person left me and here by "everything" i mean everything including coding, drawing, sleeping, studying etc. but somehow i started coding again just to create this webpage and just to wish you a happy birthday. even if you don't like it, I won't be upset because i know it's not worth of your love. but still happy birthday Chera.</small>

          <p>I don’t know if you will ever open this webpage, but still, I wrote everything that was on my mind without being sure if you would ever see it. But if you did open it and came this far, then thank you — thank you so much.</p>
          <br>
          <p>I didn’t come here to blame you or to prove myself innocent or anything like that. I wanted to make this page just to wish you a very happy birthday, but I couldn’t help myself from including all these useless paragraphs and things. I wanted to make it all about wishing you on this precious day, but it turned out like this. I’m sorry.<p>
            <br>
          <p>I really couldn’t help myself. I was afraid that you’d block me again and I’d never ever have the chance to talk to you again. You don’t know how many times I’ve cried and prayed just to get a chance to talk to you — even if it’s just for two minutes — but that time never came.</p>
          <br>
           <p>I bought this SIM card almost a month ago and I wanted to text you, but I didn’t. I waited for this day instead. All this time, I’ve been creating this page. Maybe I’ll get blocked again. But Rimi, listen to me for one last time, please. I really love you. Even if you don’t, I still do.</p>

          <p>You said that I ruined your trust and your studies, but how could you say that, dear? Tell me — didn’t I try to make your studies easier just so that you could get more marks than me? Didn’t I help you every time you asked, and even when you didn’t ask? Tell me I didn’t.</p>
          <br>
           <p>I wanted to give you all of my books and notes that I made so carefully just so they could help you understand the hard topics. But you refused to take them. You never came, and you said you didn’t want anything from me. I cried that day too.</p>
           <br>
          <p>After the Madhyamik results came out, I asked Abhijit sir about your result, but he said you didn’t tell him. I deliberately waited, thinking one day you’d come and tell me. I’ve waited every single day for you, and I still do.</p>
          <br>
           <p>Do you know how happy I was believing that you’d come and wish me on my birthday? I was waiting so excitedly, but you never came. I cried that day too. I have always hated my birthday, but I thought at least on that day you would come — even if it was just to wish me — but that never happened.</p>
           <br>
           <p>"You had your reasons not to come, and I had my reasons to believe you would. It’s not your fault — it’s me, the one who’s as worthless as nothing."</p>

          <p>I still remember the very first dream you had about the two of us. I wonder if you remember it too. I still remember all those memories we made together. I wonder if they ever run through your mind as well. Maybe I’m being dramatic again, but I wanted every wish and every dream we had to come true.</p>
          <br>
           <p>I was determined to get a better job and give you everything you ever wished for. That day, you said your maa, bapi, and sister are more important than me — and I truly respect that — but was I ever there, even after them, dear? I guess you were really just a dream of mine, a dream that was never meant to come true. And Maybe I Was Never Meant To Belong.</p>
           <br>
           <p>You said that "coming into a relationship with me" Was a mistake of yours but for me it was the most beautiful yet happiest moment that ever happened in my life and i really mean it</p>
           <br>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 5vh;;">You are so beautiful, Rimi. You are magical, I wish I could see your smile again. I should have held you a little tighter when I hugged you for the last time — but who could’ve known that would be our last hug.</p>

          <p style="margin-top: -6vh;">Anyway, after spending countless teary nights praying just to see you one last time, I finally saw you a month ago when I was heading home from school. I saw you on your father’s bike — you two were going home. When I saw you, you were just beside me. I was in the rickshaw, looking at you with teary eyes, but you didn’t see me. Or maybe you didn’t want to.</p>
          <br>

           <p>I don’t know if you’ll believe it or not, but after seeing you, I don’t know why, I just started crying. My eyes filled with tears on their own. I saw you getting farther and farther away. I wished I could see you a little longer.</p>
           <br>

           <p>I don’t know if you’ll ever read this — and I guess, who would read something so useless anyway? — but if you really did, then just know that you are awesome, you are perfect and pure, you are divine.</p>
           <br>

           <p>I don't know how you really are living your life, i just wish it isn't with sadness or sorrow, i said these things not to hurt you again please don't get me wrong, be happy dear I'm sorry for ruining your day I'm sorry. i really want to see you happy and safe.</p>
           <br>

          <p>I want you to be happier than ever. Please, dear, be safe and healthy. Be happy, Sonai. I love you. Just stay safe, stay happy, and stay healthy. Take care.</p>
